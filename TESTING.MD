# Epics and User Stories

For simplicity, the App design was divided into 3 major Epics

* Admin
* Ride Sharing
* Messaging

**Admin** By using Django framework, most of the admin would be taken care of by the built in user models and account handling
Only the extended user data had to be integrated to allow tracking of information for the Ride sharing specifically.

**Ride Shring**
All user stories relating to hitching a ride with another driver fall under this category.

**Messaging**
Once Admin and Ride Sharing were accomplihed an additional layer of in app messaging became possible.



# Validator Testing

## W2C HTML Validator
It is a known issue that the W3C Validator does not recognise django template language (DTL) and flags it as an error.
The focus was on finding any HTML errors and bad badpractices AROUND the DTL issues.

## Jigsaw CSS Validator

## PEP8 Python Validator

 - No errors were returned when passing through the official [CI pep8 Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)
