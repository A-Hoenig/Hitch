# Epics and User Stories

For simplicity, the App design was divided into 3 major Epics

* Admin
* Ride Sharing
* Messaging

**Admin** By using Django framework, most of the admin would be taken care of by the built in user models and account handling. Only the extended user data had to be integrated to allow tracking of information for the Ride sharing specifically.

**Ride Shring**
All user stories relating to hitching a ride with another driver fall under this category.

**Messaging**
Once Admin and Ride Sharing were accomplished an additional layer of in app messaging became possible.


# Validator Testing

## 1. W3C HTML Validator
It is a known issue that the W3C Validator does not recognise django template language (DTL) and flags it as an error.
The focus was on finding any HTML errors and bad badpractices AROUND the DTL issues.
All HTML files for the project pass W3C Validator (with the noted exceptions).

## 4. Chrome DEV Tools Lighthouse

Code was inspected and tested through Chrome lighthouse and all pages returned acceptable scores. Changes were made where neccessary to achieve 100% accessibility for screen readers and graphics contrast.

The default bootstrap colors did cause some issues in the your trips page where even large type with color primary on a grey background was being flagged as having not enough contrast. The use of color to highight important information in an eyecatching way and subdue less important infos was therefore not possible in this context.

Text is shown mostly black to satisfy accessibility suggestions.

# Manual Testing

Since this app is based on interaction between users/drivers and hitchers at its core, the relevant displays and interaction based on user type and request needs to be tested.

Essentially there are 4 types of user / visitor to the website.

1. Unregistered visitor - can see the about page, visit the Ride and Hitch page to view upcoming trip and is directed to sign up if interested
2. Registered user interested in giving a ride (Driver)
3. Registered user interested in hitching a ride (Hitcher)
4. Admin user - direct db access for setting up a new Region, deleteing users and data care

For testing purposes 4 drivers and 3 Hitcher accounts have been created that can interact with each other. All accounts except Admin have the same Password to ease switching between accounts and verifying app logic and correect display. Admin and User password have been provided elsewhere.

## Users:
| User       | Role | PW |
| :-------------- |:------ | :------ |
|Admin|Admin|AdminPW|
|Angie|Driver/Hitcher|StandardPW|
|Driver1|Driver/Hitcher|StandardPW|
|Driver2|Driver/Hitcher|StandardPW|
|Hitcher1|Hitcher Only|StandardPW|
|Hitcher2|Hitcher Only|StandardPW|
|Hitcher3|Hitcher Only|StandardPW|
|Visitor|Internet browser|No PW|
