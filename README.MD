<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Running the app

The finished app is hosted with HEROKU here:
<br>
<a href="https://MEGA-QUIZ-c93f32d70f60.herokuapp.com/">MEGA-QUIZ</a>
<br/>

For full app functionality, a google sheet needs to be set up with API credentials as well.
A step by step guide on how to do this can be referenced [Here (README_googleAPI)](README_googleAPI.md)

once the google sheet is created,

1. Fork or clone the repository and enter your IDE
2. add the creds.json file to the root directory
2. In the terminal / command line type: **python3 run.py** to run the app on your IDE

## Repository

###  **Deploying to Heroku**

1. Go to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login), create account if you don't have and log in.

2. Head to your dashboard and click "New", then "Create new app"

    <details>
    <summary>New / Create New App</summary>
              
    ![New/CreateNewApp](/assets/images/deployment/step1-create-new-app.png)  

    </details>

3. Next step is to give your app a name and to choose region. After that click on "Create app".

    <details>
    <summary>Name / Region / Create</summary>
              
    ![Name/Region/Create](/assets/images/deployment/step2.png)  

    </details>

4. After that head to "Settings" tab which you can find on top of your Heroku page and under the "Config Vars" set your Key/Value Pairs.

    <details>
    <summary>CREDS / PORT</summary>
              
    ![CREDS/PORT](/assets/images/deployment/step3.png)  

    </details>

    First Key = **CREDS**. Value: Paste content of **creds.json** file  
    Second Key = **PORT**. Value: **8000**

5. Then in the "Buildpacks" section you will need to add buildpacks. Pay attention to the order in which you add buildpacks you need. In my case I had to add Python first and nodejs second.

    <details>
    <summary>Buildpacks</summary>
              
    ![Buildpacks](/assets/images/deployment/step4.png)  

    </details>

6. First add "Python", by clicking on Python icon and then click on "Add Buildpack".

    <details>
    <summary>Python</summary>
              
    ![Python](/assets/images/deployment/step5-python.png)  

    </details>

7. Then add "nodejs", by clicking on nodejs icon and then click on "Add Buildpack".

    <details>
    <summary>nodejs</summary>
              
    ![nodejs](/assets/images/deployment/step6-nodejs.png)  

    </details>

8. Then head to "Deployment" tab which you can also find on top of your Heroku page and under "Deployment method" click on "GitHub"(in my case that's where my repository is).

    <details>
    <summary>GitHub</summary>
              
    ![GitHub](/assets/images/deployment/step7-github.png)  

    </details>

9. After that, just under the "Deployment method" section is "Connect to GitHub" section where you need to find your repository and then click on "Connect".

    <details>
    <summary>Connect</summary>
              
    ![Connect](/assets/images/deployment/step8.png)  

    </details>

10. Just under "Connect to GitHub" section is "Automatic deploys" section where you can click on "Enable Automatic Deploys" if that's what you want and just under is "Manual Deploy" section, where you need to click on "Deploy Manually".

    <details>
    <summary>Enable Automatic Deploys / Deploy Manually</summary>
              
    ![EnableAutomaticDeploys/DeployManually](/assets/images/deployment/step9-deployment-type.png)  

    </details>
